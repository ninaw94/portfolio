Assignment

Create a next.js application containing pages with the solutions of assignments 3 and 5 (as components). On the Homepage (index.js) create a Link list to these pages. The list should be rendered based on a data fetch operation (getStaticProps()), returning an array of data objects containing properties url and text, eg

{url: "/WebRTC", text: "WebRTC Example"}
3:
Create a React App similar to the one presented in the Lab for storing Persons (firstname, lastname)
Use a table (not a list) for listing the entries, all fields should be changeable individually.

5:
Extend the lab example, so that css filters (at least the ones presented in class but feel free to add your own) are also applied on the snapshot and can be changed dynamically by choosing one from a radio group. Create slider elements for changing the filter parameter(s) dynamically.
